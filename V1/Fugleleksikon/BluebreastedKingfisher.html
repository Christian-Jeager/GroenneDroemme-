                <h1>About the Blue-Breasted Kingfisher</h1>
                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>The blue-breasted kingfisher (Halcyon malimbica) is a fairly large kingfisher (25cm high) with a distinctive blue breast from which it takes its name. 
                    You can also recognise it by its huge red and black bill. The sexes are fairly similar in appearance.
                </p>
                <h2>Call</h2>
                <p>Its call is a loud and far-carrying, undulating laughing trill: begins with a sharp ti or chiu succeeded by a series of mournful whistles chiu pu-pu-pu-pu ku ku ku ku. 
                    There is a raucous flight alarm call tchup tchup-tchup-tchup.
                </p>
                <h2>Where and when</h2>
                <p>It can be seen at any time of year in The Gambia, near water and especially in the mangroves of the River Gambiaâ€™s tributaries, usually hiding in the shade. 
                   The mangroves around Mandina Lodge, as well as Kotu creek would be a good bet.
                </p>
                <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                <p>
                    It is omnivorous, mainly eating insects as well as arthropods, fish, frogs and palm oil kernels. Pairs breed in the late rainy season, nesting in termite mounds.
